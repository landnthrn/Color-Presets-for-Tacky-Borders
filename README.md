### NOTE:

I'm on Windows 10 and Tacky Borders works just fine on it, I fixed a couple bugs though, not sure if they were due to Windows 10 or not.  

- There was a border across each of my monitors, it was thinking my monitor screens were a window or something.  

- And being on a dual monitor setup whenever I fullscreened something on one window it would bleed over a little to other monitor.  
*(Probably shouldn't call this a bug cause it was just a matter of thickness)*  

Both are fixed for all the color presets.
